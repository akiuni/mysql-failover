# mysql-failover
automatic failover script for mysql

I have created this repository so as to share and improve a little script intended to automate MySQL failover operations.
At this time, it is a simple BASH script as a proof of concept. If it becomes reliable and usefull for the community, I'd like to port in to C programming ( based on the mysql libraries ).

So feel free to download, test, and make propositions

Best regards
Julien
